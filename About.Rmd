# Change index.html above to about.html, once site is setup
# For now, I'm following the instructions at:
# https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/
# In these instructions, the first part of file.path was 'dirname(input_file)' assuming the file
# was in the main directory. However, I'm following my practice of putting .Rmd files in the 
# rmarkdown directory. To get knitr to work, I've used the rprojroot command to redirect to main
# directory.

## About the Project

Inspired by the [52 Hike Challenge](https://www.52hikechallenge.com/), I am taking my own approach, by taking a weekly "saunter" in a different local trail for every week of 2020. These hikes will be summarized in a table on the home page with links to tracking software sites, so that folks can take their own saunters.
