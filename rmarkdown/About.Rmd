## About the Project

Inspired by the [52 Hike Challenge](https://www.52hikechallenge.com/), I am taking my own approach, by taking a weekly "saunter" in a different local trail for every week of 2020. These hikes will be summarized in a table on the home page with links to tracking software sites, so that folks can take their own saunters.
