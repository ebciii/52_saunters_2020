  Towanda St. is the address of the walled off property running along the
  first part of the White Trail terminus. There are a number of trails that
  can be a bit confusing in this area, but this hike helped sort that out.
  Need to spend more time exploring the connections down the covered bridge.
  This a typical winter day in the Wiss
