  This moderate hike was the most recommended destination in the
  Delaware Gap by the "Hiking and Backpacking Pennsylvania" FA page.
  The leg closer to river, which I did going up, is steeper. I
  deviated from the published route by taking a spur trail to "Table"
  a cliff that runs quite a distance above Lake Lenape. Today was
  extremely warm for January, getting in to the 70s. Sadly, there
  were many hemlock trees that were down, presumably taken out by
  adelgids. The trail on the return trip running along the south
  side of Lake Lenape had recently been cleared. Overall, highly
  recommended hike with great vistas that's reasonably challenging.
