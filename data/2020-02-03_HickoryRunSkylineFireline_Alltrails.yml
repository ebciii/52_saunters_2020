  Started slowly from trailhead on Rt. 534 along an access road. It was flat,
  but pretty muddy. The Switchback Trail climbed the ridge in a eponymous manner
  , which was a good climb. After hitting the Skyline Trail, it was flat on the
  plateau, and eventully opened up to a vista of the Lehigh River below. There
  was a picnic table at the vista, and I had a snack while enjoying the view.
  Skyline and Fireline Trails paralleled along the top of the drop off down
  to the Lehigh River. It was warm, and I was wearing short sleeves. In Febuary!
  Got a picture. The trails diverged, and I took Fireline along a large meadow.
  The trail went up and down and eventually dropped back down to Hickory Run
  Trail, which was the access road leading back to the trailhead. Moderately
  hard trail with nice overlook of Lehigh River...eventually. The first part was
  a bit dull, and the Switchback was a pretty tough climb. Beautiful day, so
  who cares.

  Serenity, calm.
