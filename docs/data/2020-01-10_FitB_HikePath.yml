  A fair amount of mud on the Lavender Trail, which has been a problem in
  the past. On the north leg of the Lavender Trail, I noticed a significantly
  large doll house in the back yard. Lots of people out today. People parked for
  100 yards above the Bells Mill Road parking lot. Balmy hike for
  January.
