  First visited the Nolde Forest Environmental Education Center, where they
  were presenting a lecture on snowshoeing. Although the information on
  snowshoeing wasn't new to me, they had a number of brochures on area
  hiking opportunities, which will undoubtedly show up in my future hikes.
  After the lecture in the education center, I moved the care to the Nolde
  Saw Mill Parking Lot, which closes at dush, whereas the eduction center
  parking lot cloases at 4pm in the winter. The hike started a bit cold, but
  I only put on a long-sleeved base layer and a rain shell, which was fine,
  once I got going. After a short stretch along the creek, there was a pretty
  good climb up to the "Rock Outcrop," where I had lunch. Decent view towards
  Reading, Neversink Mountain, and I was told you could see the Pagoda at
  night. The hike down went through a decidous forest with the occasional pine
  tree. However, there were many pine trees down. The went through a parking
  lot on Oregon Rd., which might be a petty trailhead in the future trips. The
  Alltrails path took an access road off the parking lot, but continuing on
  Coffee Pot Trail may have been better. After a brief connector trail, the
  Alltrails path went along another access road, where the parallel Watershed
  Trail would have been a better choice. Nonetheless, it was a nice hike along
  Punches Run. There were >10 folks on the trail, but one hiker commented that
  it was particularly crowded on this nice, winter day. Overall, it was a nice
  hike with some good climbs. Alot of civilization nearby, but the Rock Outcrop
  was removed enought to give a good view, which was reasonably scenic.
