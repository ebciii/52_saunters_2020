  This is one of the few parts of the Wissahickon that I had not hiked.
  It is isolated from the rest of the Wissahickon, and more or less
  embedded in a neighborhood. There were a fair number of people in the park.
  You are always in sight of the residential area around it, so it's nicer
  for the neighbors than for most folks.
